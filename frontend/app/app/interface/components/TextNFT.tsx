        NFTs Explained: A Must-Read Guide to Everything Non-Fungible
      </Typography>
      <p id="author">BY JOLENE CREIGHTON • JANUARY 12, 2023</p>
      <p>
        At this point, it’s almost impossible to ignore non-fungible tokens
        (NFTs). In recent years, NFTs have started to cause paradigm shifts
        across very disparate sectors of our society — transforming everything
        from finance to art. There’s good reason to suspect that, once their
        full potential is realized, almost no industry will be left untouched
        (yes, we’re looking at you, gamers).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, since going mainstream in 2021, NFTs have been a frequent
        source of hype, confusion, and drama (yes, drama!). So if you’re new to
        the space, it can be pretty challenging to separate NFT fact from
        fiction. And honestly, it’s not much easier for people who are
        established collectors and builders in the community. NFTs are still a
        very new technology, and things change so rapidly that it’s tough for
        everyone to keep up. But don’t fret. We’re here to solve all your NFT
        woes. Here, we explain what NFTs are, dive into their pros and cons, and
        cover all the latest developments and innovations.

      <h3>What’s an NFT?</h3>
      <p>
        A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data that lives on a blockchain.
        Each NFT has a unique identification code that can’t be replicated or
        copied and metadata that can be linked to a variety of things to provide
        immutable proof of ownership. For example, the metadata an NFT contains
        can be tied to digital images, songs, videos, or avatars. It can also be
        linked to physical items, like cars and yachts, or used to give an NFT
        owner access to exclusive merchandise, tickets to live or digital
        events, or other exclusive perks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this respect, NFTs allow individuals to create, buy, and sell things
        in an easily verifiable way using blockchain technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is especially relevant when it comes to digital items, as NFTs give
        creators a way to establish an item’s provenance. For the uninitiated,
        “provenance” is documentation that authenticates the creator, ownership
        history, and appraisal value of a particular piece of art. Prior to
        NFTs, there was no way to verify the creator and ownership history of
        digital works.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to creating and selling NFTs, the process is really rather
        simple. It works like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          An individual (or company) selects a unique asset to link to an NFT.
        </li>
        <li>
          They add the object to a blockchain that supports NFTs through a
          process called “minting,” which creates the NFT.
        </li>
        <li>
          The NFT now represents that item on the blockchain, verifying proof of
          ownership in an immutable record.
        </li>
        <li>
          The NFT can be kept as part of a private collection, or it can be
          bought, sold, and traded using NFT marketplaces and auctions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        As you might imagine, the technical definition is a bit more convoluted.
        If you’re interested in that kind of breakdown, our NFT dictionary gives
        you a comprehensive overview of all the technology and infrastructure in
        the NFT ecosystem.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>How are NFTs different from cryptocurrency?</h3>
      <p>
        You use the money in your bank account to purchase goods and services in
        the real world. Similarly, cryptocurrency is what you use for any and
        all transactions on the blockchain. Crypto can be purchased or converted
        into fiat currencies (dollars, euros, yen, etc.) or other
        cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) via crypto exchanges. By
        contrast, an NFT is a unique and irreplaceable asset that can be
        purchased using cryptocurrency. It can gain or lose value independent of
        the currency used to buy it, just like a popular trading card or a
        unique piece of art.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In short: NFTs are non-fungible, and cryptocurrencies are fungible.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        To better understand this, it makes sense to think of traditional fiat
        currencies. If we asked you to let us borrow a dollar, you wouldn’t open
        your wallet and say, “Which one-dollar bill do you want?” Doing so would
        be silly, as each $1 bill represents the same thing and can be exchanged
        for any other $1 bill. That’s because the U.S. dollar is fungible.
        Cryptocurrencies are also fungible. They’re not unique and can easily be
        traded and replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        NFTs, on the other hand, are non-fungible in the sense that no two are
        the same. Each NFT is a unique unit of data that cannot be replaced by
        an identical version because there is no identical version.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to NFTs, uniqueness and scarcity increase their appeal and
        desirability. And as is true of all rare items, this scarcity allows
        individuals to sell their NFTs for premium prices.
      </p>

      <h3>Why own NFTs?</h3>
      <p>
        The demand for NFT art has exploded recently. However, there is still a
        lot of skepticism. After all, NFTs are generally tied to digital files.
        How is owning such an NFT different from a screenshot of a photo? Does
        “proof of ownership” mean anything? To help you decide, here are some of
        the main reasons why people own NFTs.
      </p>
      <h4>1) It empowers artists</h4>
      <p>
        Publishers, producers, and auction houses often strong-arm creators into
        contracts that don’t serve their interests. With NFTs, artists can mint
        and sell their work independently, allowing them to retain the IP and
        creative control. Artists can also earn royalties from all secondary
        sales of their work.
        <br />
        In this respect, NFTs have the potential to create fairer models by
        bypassing the gatekeepers that currently control creative industries,
        and many individuals buy NFTs because it’s a way of empowering and
        financially supporting the creators that they love.
      </p>
      <h4>2) Collectibility</h4>
      <p>
        Despite costing less than 5 cents to make, a 1952 Mickey Mantle rookie
        card sold for $5.2 million. This happened because of the history,
        rarity, and cultural relevance of the card. NFTs are, in many ways, the
        digital version of this. For individuals who want to build a collection
        of digital assets, NFTs offer a unique opportunity that hasn’t existed
        outside of traditional collectibles and art markets ever before.
      </p>
      <h4>3) Investment </h4>
      <p>
        Some NFT owners simply want an asset that will increase in value. In
        this respect, some collectors treat NFTs as an investment — much like
        traditional art. Want proof? Mike Winkelmann, a prominent American
        digital artist known professionally as Beeple, sold his Everydays: The
        First 5000 Days composite at Christie’s for $69 million in March of
        2021. <br />
        This may seem strange to some, as everyone can see and interact with the
        image. However, as noted, there can only be one NFT owner. For some,
        this is enough. Yet, market volatility makes NFT investment a high risk,
        with the potential for major losses.
      </p>
      <h4>4) Community</h4>
      <p>
        NFT Ownership also comes with social benefits, as many creators have
        turned their NFT projects into vibrant communities. The Bored Ape Yacht
        Club is, perhaps, the best example of community building in relation to
        an NFT project. Collectors get access to a members-only discord,
        exclusive merchandise, a vote in the future of the project, tickets to
        virtual meetups, and more. As such, for many collectors, owning an NFT
        how they socialize with friends and a matter of identity.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating, buying, and selling NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, wading into the NFT market isn’t as simple as it might
        sound. After all, you can’t exactly buy an NFT with a dollar and then
        carry it home with you. You’ll need cryptocurrency to fund your NFT
        transactions and a crypto wallet to safely store the data when you
        purchase (or mint) your own NFTs. And that’s just the beginning. In this
        section, we’ll talk about how NFTs are created, traded, stored, and
        managed.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you’re wondering how you can get started with NFTs, this is the
        section for you.

      <h4>Step 1 – Get a crypto wallet</h4>
      <p>
        In short, a crypto wallet is a physical device or computer program that
        allows you to store and transfer digital assets. There are two basic
        types of crypto wallets: software and hardware wallets. When it comes to
        minting and shorter-term trades, a hot wallet is the way to go. But for
        safety reasons, you should use a hardware wallet to store your most
        valuable assets.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A software wallet (also known as a “hot wallet”):</b> This is an
        application that can be downloaded and installed on your device.
        Software wallets are more convenient and can be accessed more easily
        than hardware wallets, as they are always connected to the internet.
        However, these wallets are more open to attacks and easier to hack. As a
        result, they are typically seen as being less secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A hardware wallet (also known as a “cold wallet”):</b> This is a
        physical device that is generally pretty similar to a USB stick that you
        might use to store files from your computer. Except that, in this case,
        you are storing your crypto and NFTs. Because these wallets can be
        completely isolated from the network, assets stored in hardware wallets
        are often considered to be far more secure than software wallets.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 2 – Buy crypto</h4>
      <p>
        Some NFT marketplaces, like Nifty Gateway and MakersPlace, let you trade
        NFTs using traditional payment methods. Others, like SuperRare and
        OpenSea, only let people use cryptocurrency. When it comes to which
        crypto you should get, Ether (ETH) is the leading one used for NFT
        transactions. It’s the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and
        it can be purchased in a few different ways, including via major trading
        platforms like Coinbase and Gemini, which allow users to buy ETH with a
        bank account or credit card.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, considering the high transaction costs and environmental impact
        associated with ETH, some want to use cryptos from other blockchains to
        trade NFTs. Alternatives like Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Flow (FLOW),
        and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) also support NFT transactions. But if
        you’re a beginner, it may be best to stick to ETH and the Ethereum
        blockchain, as it has a lot more marketplaces and users. FURTHER

      </p>
      <h4>Step 3 – Find a marketplace</h4>
      <p>
        One thing to consider when choosing a marketplace is whether or not you
        intend to mint one NFT at a time and place it up for auction or mint a
        collection or batch of NFTs that are each individually priced. For the
        latter, consider a few of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces. OpenSea
        is the most popular NFT marketplace, with over 1 million active user
        wallets on the platform. LooksRare and Rarible are two of the most
        formidable OpenSea competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you intend to mint 1/1 NFTs, on the other hand, platforms like
        SuperRare, Foundation, and Zora are your best bet.
      </p>
      <p>
        And do be prepared, minting comes with an initial cost. Most of the
        time, you’ll only need to pay a gas fee (transaction fee) to mint, but
        sometimes marketplaces will tack on extra costs. Similarly, make sure
        you do your due diligence when researching royalty splits. You are not
        guaranteed to have cross-platform royalties when you mint on a platform
        like OpenSea or Rarible. Though there are smart-contract and minting
        tools like CXIP that help tackle this problem and 0xSplits that help
        with automated royalty splits to ensure you receive secondary sales
        royalties no matter where your NFTs are resold.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 4A – Mint an NFT</h4>
      <p>
        New NFTs are created via a process called “minting.” This is the
        procedure of associating a specific set of data — the NFT — with a
        specific asset or object. When picking a unique asset, keep in mind that
        you must own the copyright and intellectual property rights for the item
        you want to mint. Take care with this process. If you create NFTs using
        assets you don’t own, you could easily end up in legal trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you select a marketplace and create an account, you can begin the
        minting process. This process will be slightly different for each
        marketplace, but you’ll typically need to upload the file you intend to
        associate with your NFT and fund the transaction using ETH or another
        cryptocurrency, depending on what blockchain you’re using. It’s also
        possible to mint a physical, real-world object, but the process is more
        complex than what we’ll cover here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the minting process is complete, you’ll have all the relevant
        information regarding your new NFT, and that NFT will be registered to
        your digital wallet. Now you can keep it, sell it, or trade it at your
        leisure.
      </p>
      <h4>Step 4B – Buy or sell NFTs</h4>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that some NFTs may not be available on the open marketplace
        or may only be purchased through specific vendors. For example,
        CryptoPunks have historically been sold through the Larva Labs website
        rather than through a public marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve found an NFT that you’d like to purchase, you may have the
        opportunity to buy it outright. In other cases, you’ll need to bid on
        the NFT of your choice and wait until the auction closes. If you’re the
        top bidder after the auction closes (or if the seller accepts your bid),
        the transaction will complete and ownership of the NFT will transfer to
        your wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that point, you now own the NFT and can buy, sell, or display it as
        you see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Selling your NFT follows a similar process as outlined above. You’ll
        need to set up the auction on the marketplace of your choice. Take the
        time to understand all the fees and different kinds of auction methods
        available to you before initiating the sale. Once the auction is
        complete, the NFT will be automatically transferred from your possession
        and the proceeds from the transaction will be transferred to you.
      </p>

      <h3>The environmental impact of NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, the NFT boom isn’t without its downsides. Among the most
        frequent criticisms relates to the energy needs for operating
        blockchains that use proof-of-work consensus systems to validate
        transactions. Before the Ethereum merge to proof-of-stake consensus, a
        validation mechanism with energy needs that are orders of magnitude
        lower, Ethereum’s energy consumption rivaled that of entire countries
        when paired with the Bitcoin blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, since the merge, Ethereum’s energy needs have fallen by a
        staggering 99.5 percent. In the past, many argued that NFTs contributed
        to blockchain’s overall carbon footprint because they promoted the use
        of the technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, many of the arguments critics used to denigrate
        proof-of-work blockchain were largely based on misinformation. Many
        appeared in articles that claimed to calculate the amount of energy
        needed to conduct a single NFT transaction, but these claims omitted the
        fact that proof-of-work consensus mechanisms mine blocks, not
        transactions, and many transactions can fit inside a single block. It’s
        also not easy to calculate how much energy a single NFT transaction
        uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if this weren’t the case, it’s important to keep perspective in
        mind when commenting on a technology’s energy needs. Numerous other
        technologies have obscene energy requirements. In fact, YouTube and
        Ethereum used to have roughly the same carbon footprint. That’s not an
        excuse regarding blockchains and the carbon footprint they leave behind,
        but it’s crucial to understand the issue in its proper context. No
        technology’s existence is as environmentally friendly as its absence,
        and deciding which technologies we deem valuable enough to continue to
        use is an ongoing conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more, some blockchains are already moving to solve the blockchain
        energy problem. For example, Solana uses a unique combination of
        proof-of-history (PoH), and several chains use a version of
        proof-of-stake mechanisms to substantially manage their energy use. The
        Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) mechanism employed by Tezos, for example,
        uses roughly two million times less energy than Ethereum did pre-merge.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are plenty of valid criticisms to consider regarding blockchain
        technology, but perhaps a better question to ask is whether or not
        publications covering the NFT space will do a better job of analyzing
        the facts before maligning it.
      </p>

      <h3>NFT usage and ownership rights</h3>
      <p>
        NFTs have a nuanced relationship with the assets tied to them. While an
        NFT is designed to represent the original asset on the blockchain, the
        NFT itself is seen as a separate entity from any content it contains.
        Throughout this article, we’ve often compared NFTs to trading cards, and
        that analogy holds true here as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say you own a vintage baseball card or a popular trading card from a
        collectible card game, like Magic: The Gathering. You own a
        representation of the original work — but you don’t own the original
        work itself. The copyright for the artwork, design, and branding of the
        card you possess are wholly owned by the card’s manufacturer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way, while NFTs represent an item on the blockchain,
        ownership of an NFT does not transfer the intellectual property or usage
        rights of that original work to you.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let’s say you buy an NFT that contains the very first
        digital copy of Harry Potter and Sorcerer’s Stone. You own the NFT. But
        that doesn’t mean you have the right to sell Harry Potter merchandise,
        make Harry Potter movies, or give others permission to use the Harry
        Potter IP for commercial purposes.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, NFT ownership and usage rights are often conflated, which has
        given rise to some buyers purchasing NFTs with the mistaken
        understanding that an NFT effectively gives them the rights to expand
        upon (and capitalized from) well-established IPs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there are some exceptions to these hard and fast rules. Bored
        Ape Yacht Club has stated publicly that all BAYC NFT owners have full
        commercial rights to that Ape. It can be monetized however the NFT owner
        sees fit to do so. Some projects like CrypToadz and Nouns have taken
        this even further by releasing their IP to the public domain under
        Creative Commons (known as CC0). But they should be viewed as the
        exception, not the rule.
      </p>
      <h4>Copyrighted content</h4>
      <p>
        Using self-minting platforms like OpenSea, it’s possible for any user to
        mint a new NFT using copyrighted content that they don’t own. This is
        dangerous for the minter, buyers, and the original artist for a few
        reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By profiting off of illegitimate content, sellers and buyers open
          themselves up to legal action by the legitimate copyright holders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legitimate NFTs issued by the copyright holder may be devalued by
          illegitimate NFTs of the same work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Buyers may not know that the content they’ve purchased is illegitimate
          or that they’ve put themselves in legal jeopardy with an illegitimate
          trade.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerns around legitimacy are one of the reasons that verified NFT
        projects and accounts are preferable. To stay safe on NFT marketplaces,
        always look for verified projects on platforms, and only follow links
        from official (and verified) user accounts on social media. <br />
        In the case of sales that take place via official websites, like with
        Art Blocks or NBA Top Shot, buyers can act with confidence knowing that
        their NFT comes from a legitimate source.
      </p>

      <h3>NFT scams explained</h3>
      <p>
        NFTs are still a new phenomenon. As a result, the market is vulnerable
        to scams that can take advantage of unsuspecting collectors. Here are a
        few scams and problems with the NFT market that you should watch out
        for.
      </p>
      <h4>Rug pulls</h4>
      <p>
        Even though large generative projects are preferred by collectors,
        there’s not always safety in numbers, and no NFT project is entirely
        without risk. In fact, many projects have fallen apart due to rug pull
        scams. A rug pull occurs when the project creators take the investment
        money for the project and disappear. By absconding with all of the
        money, the team leaves collectors with a valueless asset. <br />
        Notably, these kinds of rug pulls often aren’t illegal. Are they
        unethical? Sure. But if a project promises to donate funds and then
        chooses to keep the money, there isn’t much that anyone can do. In rare
        instances, a rug pull may count as fraud, but this often isn’t the case.{" "}
        <br />
        Rug pulls can also happen when NFT developers remove the ability for
        investors to sell their tokens. These kinds of rug pulls are illegal,
        and you may be able to recoup your money. However, it will probably cost
        you a lengthy court battle. Additionally, many NFT creators don’t use
        their legal names, so it may be difficult (or even impossible) to track
        them down. <br />
      </p>
      <h4>Wash trading</h4>
      <p>
        As with stocks and other collectibles, market manipulation can happen
        during NFT auctions. <br />
        Working together, a group of potential buyers can drive up the price of
        an NFT by artificially inflating the bid price until an unsuspecting
        buyer joins the fray. After the sale, the asset deflates in value,
        leaving the buyer with a valueless NFT. One of the most common ways of
        doing this with NFTs is with wash trading. Wash trading occurs when a
        user controls both sides of an NFT trade, selling the NFT from one
        wallet and purchasing it from another. <br />
        When many transactions like this are executed, the trade volume rises.
        As a result, it looks like the underlying asset is highly sought after.
        This has the effect of increasing the value (the price) of the NFT in
        question. In fact, some NFT wash traders have executed hundreds of
        transactions through self-controlled wallets to try and increase demand.{" "}
        <br />
      </p>
      <h4>Phishing scams</h4>
      <p>
        Whether through fake advertisements, NFT giveaways, or some other form
        of coercion, scammers will sometimes ask for your private wallet keys
        and/or other sensitive information like your seed phrase.
        <br />
        Depending on what information they get access to, the scammer can then
        access your wallet and remove any cryptocurrency or NFTs stored within
        or sign transactions without your consent. Because blockchain is
        decentralized and often anonymous (i.e. there’s no regulatory authority
        and individuals don’t have submit proof of identity to use it) there’s
        generally no way to recover your assets if this happens.
        <br />
        Just like password phishing emails, these scams come in all stripes, and
        they can be very hard to spot if you aren’t looking for them. As a
        reminder: Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone or
        they will be able to access your funds, and only follow links from
        official websites and accounts.
        <br />
        Sometimes, even that’s not safe…
      </p>

      <h3>Taxes and NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        Taxes, as they pertain to NFTs and crypto, can be complicated.
        Especially since tax responsibilities vary by country. But throughout
        every context, a crucial facet of NFTs and taxes is that acquiring a
        large sum of money by trading NFTs will almost always be considered a
        capital gain, and be taxed as such. So make sure to keep a record of
        profits and losses, at the very least.
        <br />
        On the other hand, NFT creators — those who have minted and sold their
        own NFTs — will need to separate trading income from that of the sales
        of their own pieces. The general rule of thumb to follow as an NFT
        artist/creator is: when you sell an NFT, you will have to pay taxes on
        the profits. Profits for NFT creators are not considered gains, rather,
        they’re income. And this income will be taxed at your regular (usually
        self-employed) income tax rate.
        <br />
        Again, tax specifics will vary based on the legalities within your
        region, but NFTs are not a tax-free investment, and that is for sure. Be
        careful if you plan to treat them as such.
        <br />
        But what about crypto philanthropy? We’ve seen a sharp rise in
        “intentional charitable donations” made via NFTs in recent years. The
        geopolitical crisis in Ukraine stands as a perfect example of how NFTs
        can be used to positively impact communities in need.
        <br />
        In fact, more than 1,300 nonprofits accepted crypto-based donations in
        the past few years, which are considered tax-deductible in the U.S.,
        among other countries. Meaning that taxpayers can get a tax-deductible
        write-off for donations they made in crypto or NFTs. But again, this
        will vary from country to country.
      </p>

      <h3>A brief history of NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        Most people first heard of NFTs in 2021. However, the tokens actually
        got their start nearly a decade earlier. “Quantum” was the first NFT
        ever created. It was minted by Kevin McCoy on Namecoin in 2014. Over the
        next two years, several other NFTs were launched on pre-Ethereum
        blockchains. However, these projects failed to reach widespread
        popularity and remained mostly unknown.
        <br />
        NFTs only started to gain mainstream momentum in 2017, when the first
        NFT collections were launched on the Ethereum blockchain. Although it
        wasn’t the first NFT project on Ethereum, CryptoPunks stands as of the
        most popular of these early collections and helped truly kickoff the
        crypto art movement.
        <br />
        The next four years were filled with a bevy of niche project launches
        across a wide range of blockchains. Then 2021 rolled around, and things
        really took off.
        <br />
        Two catalysts helped start the 2021 bull run. The first was the COVID-19
        pandemic. It caused individuals worldwide to become more digitally
        native, and platforms like Twitter and Clubhouse quickly became Web2
        bastions for Web3’s most excited builders. The second is Beeple, who
        became the first creator to sell an NFT with a major auction house.
        Christie’s auction for Beeple’s “Everydays — The First 5000 Days” closed
        for $69 million, and NFTs could no longer be ignored.
        <br />
        As mainstream adoption increased, so did the sales volumes and price
        points. This led to an explosion of interest from companies and brands
        looking to launch their own NFT projects. Early adopters include brands
        like Coca-Cola, Taco Bell, Hot Wheels, and Adidas.
        <br />
        What’s next? It’s honestly hard to say. Given how young NFTs are at the
        moment, where NFTs stand now is likely to look vastly different within a
        short period of time.
      </p>

      <h3>A timeline of innovative and popular NFTs</h3>

      <h4>Quantum (2014)</h4>
      <p>
        As noted, the world’s first NFT was minted by Kevin McCoy on Namecoin in
        2014. It’s called “Quantum,” and it was sold in 2021 via Sotheby’s for
        $1.47 million. There was a subsequent lawsuit due to ownership disputes,
        and another party with the Twitter handle @EarlyNFT registered as the
        owner of the NFT ahead of McCoy’s 2021 sale. The contents of the 2014
        blockchain entry seem to indicate that the Twitter user may, in fact, be
        the rightful owner — not McCoy.
        <br />
        However, given that NFTs are largely unregulated, it remains to be seen
        exactly how this will play out from a legal perspective.
      </p>
      <h4>Spells of Genesis (March 2015)</h4>
      <p>
        Spells of Genesis was created in 2015 by EverdreamSoft on top of
        Bitcoin. It’s the very first blockchain trading card game. As such, it
        helped usher in a new era of gaming — one in which players have true
        ownership of their digital assets. Each card contains a piece of art
        representing a historic moment in blockchain history. Players collect,
        trade, and combine cards to create a powerful deck. Once this is done,
        they can challenge various opponents.
      </p>
      <h4>Rare Pepe (September 2016)</h4>
      <p>
        The Rare Pepe Wallet was created by developer Joe Looney. It’s a
        web-based, encrypted wallet that runs on Counterparty, and lets users
        trade and destroy their Rare Pepes. Out of the nearly 1,800 cards issued
        across 36 series, the Series 1, Card 1 is the rarest and most valuable.
        It pays homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or group that created
        Bitcoin. It’s called the Nakamoto Card, and holding one (there are only
        300 total) is the only way to gain entry into the 300 Club.
      </p>
      <h4>CryptoPunks (June 2017)</h4>
      <p>
        CryptoPunks first hit the market in 2017, launched by product studio
        Larva Labs, and it directly inspired the current crop of popular
        generative PFP projects, like Bored Ape Yacht Club. In this respect,
        it’s one of the most influential NFT projects of all time. Each Punk is
        algorithmically generated and entirely unique, with some characteristics
        rarer than others. The Punks themselves typically go for hundreds of
        thousands, with some trades easily climbing into the millions.
      </p>
      <h4>CryptoKitties (November 2017)</h4>
      <p>
        CryptoKitties was created by Canadian studio Dapper Labs and launched in
        2017. CryptoKitties is a collectible game where players purchase, breed,
        and trade virtual cats. Each cat is assigned 12 unique traits, including
        fur patterns, accent colors, eye shape, and more. Each cat is 100%
        unique, but breeding them isn’t free: You’ll need to spend ETH on the
        platform to trade and breed your cats. As one of the first blockchain
        games built on Ethereum, it received widespread media attention and
        inspired ERC-721, an open standard that describes how to build NFTs on
        Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.
      </p>
      <h4>Axie Infinity (March 2018)</h4>
      <p>
        One of the first blockchain games, Axie Infinity is an online video game
        based on NFTs and Ethereum. First launched in 2018, Axie uses a
        “play-to-earn” model, meaning that users can earn in-game cryptocurrency
        by playing. Created by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, the game lets
        players collect creatures called Axies to fight, build, and achieve
        victory within the game. The platform also features a marketplace where
        individuals can sell game items and Axies to other players. In essence,
        it allows Axie users to increase their overall market value by engaging
        with the game.
      </p>
      <h4>Decentraland (February 2020)</h4>
      <p>
        Decentraland is a browser-based game where users can buy and sell
        virtual plots of land and in-game items. It was created by Argentinians
        Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano, who began working on the project in
        2015. It went live in 2020, and it’s currently run by the nonprofit
        Decentraland Foundation. Everything in-game is a sellable item including
        avatar wearables, estates, and the land on which these estates sit.
        Notably, it also stands as the first virtual world owned by users, and
        is considered an early model for the metaverse.
      </p>
      <h4>NBA Top Shot (October 2020)</h4>
      <p>
        One of the more popular NFT collections on the market is NBA Top Shot.
        It allows users to purchase NFTs created using video clips of their
        favorite players and key basketball moments. The clips are cut and
        numbered in a series, and multiple copies are minted to create varying
        levels of rarity. In 2021 alone, the virtual platform had more than 1.1
        million registered users who traded some $800 million in NFTs, bringing
        new levels of mainstream awareness. Notably, NBA Top Shot is one of the
        most affordable NFTs for starting collectors, with most selling for well
        under $100 upon release and purchasable through standard fiat
        currencies.
      </p>
      <h4>Art Blocks (November 2020)</h4>
      <p>
        Art Blocks launched in 2020 and dramatically streamlined the creation of
        generative art. It uses generative scripts to create unique works of
        computer-generated art. Simply select a project that you like, and then
        mint an NFT from that collection. Your result will be randomly generated
        on demand, so you won’t know exactly what your NFT will look like until
        you make the purchase.
      </p>
      <h4>Bored Ape Yacht Club (April 2021)</h4>
      <p>
        A wildly popular PFP NFT, Bored Ape Yacht Club has received massive
        critical acclaim since its founding. Created by product studio Yuga
        Labs, the collection features 10,000 unique NFTs, and NFT holders have
        full commercialization rights to the Ape that they own. Most Ape sales
        go for hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is why they are the most
        prominent and profitable examples of the medium. Bored Ape also played a
        major role in kicking off the avatar craze (using NFTs as profile
        pictures). In many ways, it’s directly responsible for cementing NFTs as
        a pop culture phenomenon.
      </p>
      <h4>Other interesting NFTs</h4>
      <p>
        Occasionally, you’ll also find other odd NFTs floating around in the
        metaverse. These may not be attached to any particular project, but
        their cultural significance or quirkiness makes them worth noting. For
        example…
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Classic internet memes like Nyan Cat and Bad Luck Brian sold as NFTs,
          and many other memes have followed suit. This enabled the artists
          behind the creations to finally be properly compensated and recognized
          for their work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the world’s most significant, real-life cultural events have
          been turned into NFTs and sold for millions. For example, Twitter
          founder Jack Dorsey’s first tweet and Tim Berners-Lee’s original
          source code for the world wide web were both auctioned off.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2021, record label LuckyMe pushed the music art space (and NFTs)
          forward dramatically when one of their hallmark artists — electronic
          sensation Jacques Greene — auctioned off the publishing rights to one
          of his singles in perpetuity.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          A host of major brands, like Lamborghini, Coachella, Time, and
          Instagram started launching NFT projects and exploring innovative ways
          non-fungibles can be incorporated into their business models and
          overall missions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In all likelihood, we’ll continue to see more quirky and innovative NFT
        uses, as brands and independent creators push the boundaries of the
        collectibles market even further in the years to come.
      </p>

      <h3>Are NFTs right for you?</h3>
      <p>
        So far, we’ve given you everything you need to better understand NFTs,
        how they operate in the market, the benefits and risks, and how to get
        started with them. But are NFTs right for you?
        <br />
        It’s a hard question to answer. In the end, it really just comes down to
        your personal preference and why you want to get involved in the first
        place. But here’s what we can tell you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          NFTs are perfect for hobbyist collectors who want to support a content
          creator, be part of a community, or own a little piece of something
          they’re passionate about.
        </li>
        <li>
          As an investment opportunity, NFTs are highly volatile and the market
          is speculative. As with art and other rare items, some NFTs have
          gained immense value over time while others have lost immense value.
        </li>
        <li>
          The value of community for NFTs can’t be understated. From Bored Ape
          Yacht Club and CryptoPunks to buying NFTs from your favorite brand or
          artist, NFTs can be a gateway to a different community and lifestyle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite the explosive popularity we’ve seen in the past few years,
          NFTs are still in their early stages, and it’s never too late to get
          started. You definitely didn’t miss the boat.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you do decide to get into the NFT ecosystem, we hope you enjoy the
        ride – we know that we certainly have.
