  NFT = "What Is an NFT? Your Guide to Non-Fungible Tokens in 2024 By Jessica Schulze (updated on Jan 30 2024) NFTs are digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. They represent various forms of digital content and may even be tethered to physical assets. Ownership of these assets is recorded in the blockchain, creating an immutable record that enables the selling and trading of NFTs. If you are not yet familiar with blockchain technology, you can learn the basics in the article What Is a Blockchain Developer (and How Do I Become One?) and browse the glossary of terms at the bottom of this page.  What does NFT stand for?  NFT stands for non-fungible token. Although non-fungible tokens are widely regarded as a new technology, the first NFT was minted in 2014 by digital artist Kevin McCoy and tech entrepreneur Anil Dash. You can trace the origins of NFTs even further back to 2012 when Meni Rosenfeld published the 'Colored Coins' whitepaper. “Colored Coins” describes the methodology for representing and managing the ownership of real-world assets on a blockchain.  What does non-fungible mean?  The term “non-fungible” is not limited to the NFT space. It is also used to describe assets in law, finance, or commerce that are difficult to exchange with similar goods. In other words, non-fungible assets are unique. You cannot replace them with similar items. Diamonds are a great non-digital example of a non-fungible good. Many different cuts, grades, and styles of diamonds exist. These qualities make them unique and non-interchangeable with other diamonds.  Non-fungible vs. fungible In contrast, bills in US currency are an example of a fungible good. You can exchange one $50 bill for five $10 bills or two $20 bills and two $5 bills. Anything that is mutually interchangeable can be described as fungible. Fungible goods are easily replaced with items of identical or practically identical value.  What is a non-fungible token?  A non-fungible token is a digital identifier recorded in the blockchain. It cannot be copied, substituted, or changed. Non-fungible tokens validate the authenticity and ownership of a digital asset. Essentially, a non-fungible token is proof of ownership. This type of certificate is digital and cannot be altered due to the nature of blockchains.  What is an NFT?  NFTs are proof of an asset’s purchase. They are not the asset itself.These circumstances mean that you can create an NFT out of virtually anything. In addition to digital objects, you can use a digital object to represent a tangible item. Here are a few examples of things that can (and have been) turned into NFTs: • Digital content like video clips and social media posts • Media files such as GIFs • Video game items like avatars and skins • Digitized fashion such as NFT sneakers The difference between cryptocurrency and NFTs Despite their similarities, cryptocurrency and NFTs are not the same thing. Cryptocurrency is, however, a digital currency used for trading NFTs. The primary difference between cryptocurrency and NFTs lies in their value. The value of cryptocurrency depends on its utility, similar to the US dollar. If every merchant in the US decided to stop accepting US dollars, their value would plummet because they are purely economical. NFTs have both economic and non-economic value. Since an NFT can represent anything from artwork to a video game, its value depends on factors like investors, collectors, and rarity.  Examples of NFTs The list below contains a few of the most widely recognized NFTs and NFT collections.  • Cryptopunks. As one of the earliest NFT collections, Cryptopunks are well-known in the NFT space. Cryptopunk #8857 went viral in September of 2021 after selling for $6.63 million or 2000 Ether (ETH), the Ethereum network’s cryptocurrency. One reason behind its staggering price tag is rarity—Cryptopunk #8857 is one of 88 Zombie Cryptopunks in existence.  • Bored Ape Yacht Club. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is an iconic NFT collection thanks to its popularity among celebrities and high-profile athletes. Much of its notoriety derives from the usage of Bored Apes as profile pictures on social media. Notably, Bored Ape #3739 sold for $2.9 million in September 2021.  • Lazy Lions. Avatars from the Lazy Lions NFT collection are trendy among those in the NFT community. Upon their debut, between 3,000 and 4,000 of the 10,000 Lazy Lion NFTs released sold in just five hours. As of July 2022, the most expensive NFT available from this collection is Lazy Lion #6632, currently listed for 2,000 ETH or $2,120,500.  Why do NFTs look like that?  You may have noticed that mainstream NFTs look strikingly similar to one another. This phenomenon is due to the usage of layering and generative coding. Layering is the process of generating a set of images from a list of visual elements. For example, you might add “hat” and “shirt” to your list and produce variations like a cowboy hat, a polo shirt, a Hawaiian shirt, and a top hat. Then, you’d use a computer program or generative coding to stack each of these layers on top of each other in a randomized order. Creators can also input rules such as “if the avatar is wearing a top hat, it cannot also be wearing a Hawaiian shirt.” These rules and variations make it possible to create thousands of unique avatars from a little over a hundred elements. Programmatically generated NFTs are similar to randomizing a character when playing a role-playing video game (RPG). RPGs often include hundreds of options for clothing, facial features, and accessories. Choosing to randomize your character rather than customize it will prompt the game to generate a random combination of each element for you.  Why are NFTs so expensive?  The value of an NFT depends on many different characteristics. A few contributing factors include: • The source's credibility • The artist's relevancy • The current market for NFTs • The utility of the NFT Why do people buy NFTs?  The reasoning behind an NFT purchase is likely to vary significantly from one person to another. Since NFTs can be made from collectible items, personal preferences or brand loyalty can drive investments. Some NFT collections strive to create an exclusive community of owners, driving sales among those who want to join. Ultimately, buying an NFT is a personal choice.  Pros of NFTs • Decentralization. Like Cryptocurrency, NFT selling and trading are not controlled by a central authority. Instead, each member of the blockchain network receives a copy of identical, immutable data (in the form of a distributed ledger). This removes the need for a mediating party because it enables people to execute transactions without trusting one another. You can learn more about decentralized finance by taking an online course like Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The Future of Finance Specialization offered by Duke University.  • Networking. Depending on the creator of the NFT, real-world perks could be tethered to purchases from their collection. Examples of these perks include access to exclusive events and membership in groups or associations.  • Artist advocacy. Anil Dash, co-creator of the first NFT, was working as a consultant to auction houses and media companies at the time of the idea's conception. Dash wrote for the Atlantic that this role had him 'obsessively thinking about the provenance, ownership, distribution, and control of artworks.' NFTs were meant to use blockchain technology to protect artists from exploitation. Instead of working with third-party companies who often siphon earnings, NFTs aimed to help artists protect their creations by connecting them with sellers and investors directly.  Cons of NFTs • Environmental impact.NFTs are traded with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). These cryptocurrencies use a protocol called Proof of Work to validate transactions. In short, Proof of Work is like a mathematical puzzle that proves a certain amount of computational power has been expended, thus confirming the validity of a blockchain transaction. This process is often called mining. As the networks grow, the puzzles become more challenging and require more computational power for miners to solve. According to some environmental advocates and financial regulators, the energy it takes to uphold this digital economy is not sustainable [2]. In 2020 alone, mining consumed more energy than the entirety of Switzerland [3].  • Community impact. Energy is expensive, leading miners to relocate their operations to areas with cheaper energy costs. These mining operations can drive up energy costs for locals and cause cities to exceed their hydropower quota. Depending on the extensiveness of the hardware, mining operations can also generate a constant, tangible vibration in the area [4].  • Legal rights. When an NFT is purchased, the owner obtains the rights to the digital asset that lives on the blockchain. They do not receive legal rights to the underlying content. If another party trademarks the artwork or item that an NFT represents, that party retains control over the legal rights of the intellectual property (IP) regardless of who owns the NFT.  • Value fluctuation. Since NFT value is not purely economic, it can fluctuate based on the current social climate. For example, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sold his first-ever tweet as an NFT last year for over $2.9 million. Today, Dorsey's NFT tweet is owned by crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi. He listed the NFT for sale at $48 million and closed the auction with just seven total bids ranging between $5-$277.  Key takeaways • NFTs are digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. They act as certificates of ownership and authenticity over an object, tangible or intangible.  • NFTs and cryptocurrency are not the same. NFTs are traded using cryptocurrency.  • The value of an NFT hinges on several factors, including social relevancy and scarcity.  • Purchasing an NFT does not inherently provide you with the rights to the artwork or asset that the NFT represents."

  EPISTEMOLOGY = "Semiotics Semiotics: definition Semiotics is the study of visual language and signs. It looks at how meaning is created, not just with words but also with images, symbols, gestures, sounds, and design.  We use semiotics to look at how different modes of communication (e.g. language, visuals, or gestures) work together to create meaning in context. This means that where and when we observe signs will impact their meaning. For example, a thumbs-up gesture usually means 'okay', but if seen at the side of the road, it means the person is looking for a free ride in a stranger's car! Fig. 1 - The meaning of the thumbs-up sign can change depending on the context.  Semiotics can help us develop a deeper understanding of the world around us, including the media we see (e.g. films, news, adverts, novels). It helps us to recognise the whole intended meaning of something.  Signs in semiotics In semiotics we analyse signs, but what exactly are they?  In semiotics, the term signs can refer to anything that is used to communicate meaning. There is a wide variety of ways we as humans communicate meaning with each other, such as: • words (e.g. the word breakfast is used to describe the meal we eat in the morning) • Images (e.g. the images used alongside a news article will impact the readers' understanding of that article) • Colours (e.g. the red light on a traffic light means stop) • Symbols (e.g. the exclamation mark '!' can convey a sense of surprise or excitement) • Gestures (e.g. a 'thumbs up' shows positivity) • Sounsd (e.g. music played on the piano in the minor key can create a sense of sadness) • Fashion (e.g. clothing can reveal a lot about a person's socioeconomic status) The meaning of signs can differ depending on the social situation and the cultural context.  For example, whilst the 'thumbs up' gesture has positive connotations in many countries, it is considered offensive in Greece, Iran, Italy, and Iraq. Another example is the colour yellow.  In the Western world (e.g. the UK and the USA), yellow is often associated with springtime and warmth; however, in Latin America (e.g. Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia) yellow can symbolise death and mourning. As you can see, it's important to study signs in context!  Semiotic theory The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) and the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) are widely considered the founders of modern semiotics. In the early 1900s, Saussure introduced the concept of signs in semiotics. He suggested that each sign is made of two parts; thesignifier and the signified.  • Signifier = The word, image, sound, or gesture representing a concept or meaning.  • Signified = The interpretation of the meaning of the signifier.  These two parts of a sign are always connected and cannot be separated.  Example An example of a sign is the word 'dog'.  • The signifier is the word ' dog ' itself.  • The signified meaning is the small furry mammal, often kept as a pet.  Example A further example is this hand gesture: Fig. 2 - The 'okay' hand gesture.  • The signifier is the symbol made by joining the thumb and the index finger together.  • The signified meaning (in the Western world) is ' everything's okay '.  Types of signifiers According to Charles Sanders Peirce, there are three different signifiers; Icons, Indexes, andSymbols.  Icon signifier An icon is a signifier with an obvious connection and physical resemblance to the signified thing. Photographs, illustrations, and maps are good examples of icon signifiers.  Example Fig. 3 - Icon signifier used to represent the United Kingdom. This image is used to represent the United Kingdom. It is an icon signifier as it has an obvious and accurate resemblance to the physical shape of the United Kingdom.  Index signifier Index signifiers are a little less obvious than icon signifiers. They are usually representations of therelationship between the signified and the signifier. The index signifier cannot exist without the presence of the signified. For example, smoke is an index signifier for fire.  Most of us know the relationship between smoke and fire and know that there cannot be any smoke without a fire.  Example Fig. 4 - Danger of death image found on some household products. Many of you will have seen this image placed on the back of potentially dangerous household products, such as bleach.  The image is not a literal representation of what can be found in the bottle (i.e. the bottle of bleach isn't full of bones!); instead, it represents the relationship between the product and the user (i.e. if someone were to drink the bleach, they could die).  The understanding of index signifiers can either be natural or learned. For example, most of us know from a very young age that a frown suggests a person is unhappy. On the other hand, we have to learn that the skull and crossbones (shown above) represent death.  Symbol signifier Symbol signifiers are the most abstract of the three, as there is no apparent connection between the signifier and the signified. Symbol signifiers can differ from country to country, and we have to take time to teach and learn their meaning.  Examples of symbol signifiers include the alphabet, numbers, and punctuation.  For example, there is no physical or literal connection between the pound symbol (£) and money itself; however, it is a symbol that everyone in the UK will understand.  For example, there is no physical or literal connection between the pound symbol (£) and money itself; however, it is a symbol that everyone in the UK will understand.  Example Fig. 5 - The image of the caduceus signifies medicine. This is an image of the staff (stick) carried by the Greek god Hermes. The original image can be traced back to 4000 BC and is believed to have associated meanings with trade, liars, and thieves. However, today we associate this symbol with medicine, and even though there is no obvious link between the image and medicine, this sign can be seen in pharmacies and hospitals all over the world.  Types of signified meaning Just like how there are three different types of signifiers, there are also three different types of signified meaning. They are: denotative meaning, connotative meaning, and myths.  Denotative meaning A sign's denotative meaning is its literal meaning. These are the obvious meanings everyone knows, i.e., the meaning found in the dictionary. For example, the denotative meaning of the word 'blue' is a primary colour between green and violet in the colour spectrum'.  Connotative meaning A sign's connotative meaning includes all of its implied and associated meanings. For example, the connotative meanings for the word 'blue' include feelings of sadness, representations of the sky and the ocean, and symbolism of trust, loyalty, and wisdom.  The interpretation of a sign's connotative meaning usually depends on the individual, and the understanding can differ from person to person.  Myths A sign's mythological meaning is usually very old and has been passed down through many generations. Mythological meanings are often religious or cultural and include many things seen in our daily lives, such as norms, values, and manners.  An example is the yin and yang image, which has many mythological meanings in Chinese cultures, such as balance, femininity, darkness, and passivity.  Fig. 6 - The yin and yang image.  Semiotic analysis Although the process of semiotic analysis has undoubtedly been around for many years, modern-day semiotic analysis in linguistics was introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce in the early 1900s.  Semiotic analysis is when we take a medium of communication (e.g. a novel, a blog, a poster, a textbook, an advertisement etc.) and interpret the denotative, connotative, and mythological meaning of all of the signs together in context.  We can use semiotic analysis when conducting discourse analysis. For example, when analysing a news article, it's important to not only consider the words used, but also how the words work alongside the images, colours, and advertisements also used. The combination of these different signs could potentially have a different meaning than viewing them on their own.  Semiotics examples One example of semiotics is the use of a red stop sign on a street. The sign itself is a symbol that represents the concept of 'stop' and is universally recognized as such. The colour red is also a signifier of danger or caution, which adds to the overall meaning of the sign. This is an example of how semiotics is used to convey meaning through the use of symbols and signifiers.  Let's take a look at two more examples of semiotic analysis. We'll start with an easy one and then look at something a little more in-depth.  Semiotic example 1: Fig. 7 - The combination of the arrow, colour, and image gives this sign its meaning. What do you think this sign means? Although there are no words here, most people around the world will recognise this as an emergency exit sign. The combination of the colour green (which has connotations with 'go'), the arrow pointing left (a universally recognised icon signifier), and the image (an index signifier which shows the relationship between going left and exiting through a door), creates the semiotic meaning of the sign. You may have also seen this similar image before: Fig. 8 - The colour green helps people recognise the exit.Using the same colours helps activate individuals' prior knowledge, adding to the sign's meaning.  Semiotic example 2: Fig. 9 - Propaganda posters can convey many different meanings.  When conducting a semiotic analysis of things such as posters, newspaper articles, book covers etc., try asking yourself the following questions: •What are the key signifiers and what do they signify? Consider the language, images, colour, and general design.  •What are the potential denotative, connotative, and mythological meanings of the signs?  •What is the context?  Let's apply these questions to the above poster from World War 1.  •The two men are shaking hands. The handshake gesture signifies 'unity' and 'welcoming'.  •The two men are shaking hands across this globe. This could signify a 'bridge' between the two countries.  •The term ' come across now ' is an imperative sentence, creating a demand and a sense of urgency.  •The image of the soldier makes it clear what type of person the Americans are hoping to attract.  •The American man wearing a suit has connotative meanings of wealth and class.  •The context of the time (during WordlWar 1) and the image of the man in uniform make it clear what 'You're needed' is referring to.  Semiotics and language teaching Semiotics and teaching a first or second language often go hand in hand; this is because teachers will use images, signs, hand gestures, and visual aids (e.g. flashcards) to help them convey meaning.  Semiotics is particularly useful in second language teaching as many signs are recognisable worldwide, meaning they make excellent teaching aids.  Take a look at the following images for example: Fig. 10 - Flashcards without a signified meaning are not very useful.  This image would be fairly meaningless to a Chinese speaker learning English as there is only a signifier and no signified meaning.  Fig. 11 - Flashcards with images can help with the learning process.  However, this image, which contains both the signifier and the signified, should be easily understood by the language learner.  Semiotics - Key Takeaways • Semiotics is the study of visual language and signs. It looks at how meaning is created, not just with words, but also with images, symbols, gestures, sounds, and design. Semiotic analysis is when we analyse all of the meanings of all of the signs together in context.  • communicate meaning.  • The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) and the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) are widely considered the founders of modern semiotics.  • According to Charles Sanders Peirce, there are three different types of signifiers; Icons, Indexes, and symbols.  • There are also three different ways signs can be interpreted: the denotative meaning, the connotative meaning, and the mythological meaning."
